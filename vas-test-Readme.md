As a user, I want see a notification popup. There can be different type of notification, temporary or permanent. The notification should be displayed with animation in the bottom right corner of the screen.

Acceptance criteria:
 1. Notification interface:
  - The notification should have content and optional title.
  - Optional should be close button
  - Display at least 2 notifications
 2. Temporary notification:
  - Once a notification is shown, loading bar is displayed and animated from left to right for 5 seconds and then notification is hidden
 3. Permanent notification:
  - A notification is shown with close button
  - If this notification is closed if we do a refresh that notification should not be shown
 4. Animations:
  - No animation is specified. You should experiment and provide one by your choice for show and hide
 5. Bonus:
  - For temporary notification show a close button with functionality to hide the notification
  - Create interface with two input fields and a button and a radio button for notification type so that we can call different notifications to max 5 notifications on the screen
  - Make the time for disappearing variable (hint: through attributes)

  This user story ensures that the notification component is functional, user-friendly, and visually integrated with the application's design.

  Technology is free of choice but our suggestion is to be as simple as it can be.
